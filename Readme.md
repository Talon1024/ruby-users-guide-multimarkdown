Ruby User's Guide
=================

This is a [MultiMarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4) conversion of the Ruby User's Guide by Mark Slagell.

The original English translation of the Ruby User's Guide was released as a
bunch of HTML/CSS files under the GNU Free Documentation License. However,
the HTML/CSS version was designed for desktop users, and as such, it is very
hard to read, if not impossible, on mobile phones. This version is intended
to enhance readability on mobile phones and other such devices, as well as
enable conversion to other formats.

How to build the HTML version
-----------------------------

Assuming you have Node.js and MultiMarkdown installed, run tohtml.js to convert
all of the .md files to HTML files.
