What is Ruby
============

Ruby is "an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming" -- what does this mean?

Interpreted Scripting Language
------------------------------

- Ability to make operating system calls directly
- Powerful string operations and regular expressions
- Immediate feedback during development

Quick and Easy
--------------

- Variable declarations are unnecessary
- Variables are not typed
- Syntax is simple and consistent
- Memory management is automatic

Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

- Everything is an object
- Classes, methods, inheritance, etc.
- Singleton methods
- "mixin" functionality by module
- Iterators and closures

Also
------

- Multiple precision integers
- Convenient exception processing
- Dynamic loading
- Threading support

If you are unfamiliar with some of the concepts above, read on, and
don't worry. The mantra of the ruby language is *quick and easy*.
